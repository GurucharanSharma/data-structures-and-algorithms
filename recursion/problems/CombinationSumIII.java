/**
 * Problem statement
 * <p>
 * You are given ‘k’ and ‘n’ and you have to do the following:-
 * <p>
 * Return all possible combinations of arrays whose elements sum is equal to ‘n’, and you can use only elements in the range '1' to '9' inclusive, and
 * you can use each element at most once, and the size of the combination should be exactly ‘k’.
 * <p>
 * If there is no combination, return an empty array.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that the 2-D array should be returned in sorted order, meaning the lexicographically smaller array should come first.
 * <p>
 * Also, at each index of the 2-D array, the elements present in the array present at that index should be in sorted order.
 * <p>
 * Note: Two combinations are called different if an element is in one combination and not in another.
 * <p>
 * Also, in the output, you will see the 2-D array returned by you.
